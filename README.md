# SodukuSolver
This is my first Java project

As the name says this program will attempt to solve a soduku, add the known numbers and it will attempt to figure out the rest.
This is a early version, alot of minor changes can be done and the algorithm is not very advanced yet but easier puzzles can be solved!
